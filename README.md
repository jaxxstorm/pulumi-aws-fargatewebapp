# Fargate Web App Package

This is a [Pulumi Multi Language Package](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumiup-pulumi-packages-multi-language-components/) for deploying a web application to Fargate.

It's written in TypeScript, but consumable from all Pulumi's supported SDKs.

It was built live on PulumiVision, you can watch us build it [here](https://pulumip.us/MultiLangComponent)
